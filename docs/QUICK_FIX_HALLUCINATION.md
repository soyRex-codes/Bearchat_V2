# QUICK FIX: Stop Model Hallucination

## 🚨 Problem: Model talks about Montana State instead of Missouri State

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX (No Retraining Needed)

### I've already updated your `chat.py` with:

1. **Explicit constraints in prompt**
   ```
   "You are an assistant for Missouri State University (MSU) 
    in Springfield, Missouri..."
   ```

2. **Better generation settings**
   - `temperature=0.3` (was 0.7) → More focused
   - `top_p=0.85` (was 0.9) → Less random

### **Test it now:**
```bash
python chat.py
```

---

## 📊 Expected Improvement

### Before:
```
You: Tell me about CS degree
Assistant: Montana State University offers... ❌
```

### After:
```
You: Tell me about CS degree
Assistant: Missouri State University in Springfield offers... ✅
```

## 🔧 If Still Hallucinating...

### **Root Cause**: Not enough training data!
- Current: ~30 examples from 1 page
- Base model: Millions of examples about ALL universities
- **Solution**: Collect MORE MSU data!

### **Target**: 500+ examples

## 🚀 Collect More Data (This Week)

```bash
# Run the smart collector
python smart_msu_collector.py

# Collect from these MSU pages:
# 1. More CS department pages (courses, faculty, research)
# 2. All scholarship pages (10+ pages)
# 3. Admissions (freshman, transfer, international)
# 4. Housing (all residence halls)
# 5. Financial aid
# 6. Other majors (nursing, business, etc.)
# 7. Student services
# 8. Campus life

# Aim for: 10-20 pages = 300-600 examples
```

---

## 📦 Combine All Data

```bash
# After collecting multiple JSON files, combine them:
python combine_training_data.py

# This creates: combined_msu_training_YYYYMMDD.json
```

---

## 🎓 Retrain with More Data

```bash
# 1. Edit enhanced_finetune.py line 58:
#    data_files="combined_msu_training_20251018.json"

# 2. Run training:
python enhanced_finetune.py

# 3. Update chat.py line 11:
#    adapter_path = "./models/latest"

# 4. Test:
python chat.py
```

## ✅ Action Checklist

**Today (5 min):**
- [x] Chat.py updated with constraints
- [ ] Test: `python chat.py`
- [ ] Note: Should be better but maybe not perfect

**This Week (1-2 hours):**
- [ ] Collect 10-20 MSU pages with `smart_msu_collector.py`
- [ ] Combine: `python combine_training_data.py`
- [ ] Retrain: `python enhanced_finetune.py`
- [ ] Test: Should be MUCH better! ✨

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

1. **`chat.py`** - Updated with constraints ✅
2. **`chat_contextual.py`** - For contextual model (optional)
3. **`combine_training_data.py`** - Merge multiple JSON files
4. **`FIXING_HALLUCINATION.md`** - Detailed explanation

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Quick fix**: ✅ Done (updated chat.py)  
**Real fix**: Need MORE training data (500+ examples)  
**How**: Collect 10-20 MSU pages with smart collector  
**Result**: Model stays focused on MSU! 🚀
